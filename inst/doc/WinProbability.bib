abstract = {The p value from the two-sample t-test has been disparaged for its apparent inability to provide a measure for the magni- tude of the mean effect. However, by knowing the p value and the sample size, a relationship is shown with Cohen’s effect size and exact confidence limits on the effect size. These confi- dence limits can be used to create plots of the normal densities consonant with the data. Exact confidence limits can also be easily derived for P(X > Y) and the odds of X being greater than Y. These latter two statistics can help us express t-test re- sults in terms of differences between individuals randomly cho- sen from the two populations, rather than in terms of differences in population means. The limitations of the commonly reported “p<0.05” and “p<0.0001” are discussed.},

@article{Hayter2012,
abstract = {This paper considers inferences concerning future observations for regression models. Specifically, the differences between future observations at two designated sets of input values are considered. Win-probabilities, which are the probabilities that one of the future observations will exceed the other, constitute a special case of this analysis. These win-probabilities, together with the more general inferences on the difference between the future observations, provide a useful and easily interpretable tool with which a practitioner can assess the information provided by the regression model, and can make decisions regarding which of the two designated sets of input values would be optimal. A multiple- linear-regressionmodelis considered in detail, although the results can be applied to any regression model with normally distributed errors. Central and non-central t-distributions are used for the analysis, and several examples of the methodologies are presented.},

abstract = {The comparison of two treatments with normally distributed data is considered. Inferences are considered based upon the difference between single potential future observations from each of the two treatments, which provides a useful and easily interpretable assessment of the difference between the two treatments. These methodologies combine information from a standard confidence interval analysis of the difference between the two treatment means, with information available from standard prediction intervals of future observations.Win-probabilities, which are the probabilities that a future observation from one treatment will be superior to a future observation from the other treatment, are a special case of these methodologies. The theoretical derivation of these methodologies is based upon inferences about the non-centrality param- eter of a non-central t-distribution. Equal and unequal variance situations are addressed, and extensions to groups of future observations from the two treatments are also considered. Some examples and discussions of the methodologies are presented.},

@article{Kieser2013,
abstract = {In drug development, it is well accepted that a successful study will demonstrate not only a statistically significant result but also a clinically relevant effect size. Whereas standard hypothesis tests are used to demonstrate the former, it is less clear how the latter should be established. In the first part of this paper, we consider the responder analysis approach and study the performance of locally optimal rank tests when the outcome distribution is a mixture of responder and non-responder distributions. We find that these tests are quite sensitive to their planning assumptions and have therefore not really any advantage over standard tests such as the t-test and the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test, which perform overall well and can be recommended for applications. In the second part, we present a new approach to the assessment of clinical relevance based on the so-called relative effect (or probabilistic index) and derive appropriate sample size formulae for the design of studies aiming at demonstrating both a statistically significant and clinically relevant effect. Referring to recent studies in multiple sclerosis, we discuss potential issues in the application of this approach.},

abstract = {This article examines statistical inference for Pr(Y < X), where X and Y are independent normal variates with unknown means and variances. The case of unequal variances is stressed. X can be interpreted as the strength of a component subjected to a stress Y, and Pr(Y < X) is the component's reliability. Two approximate methods for obtaining confidence intervals and an approximate Bayesian probability interval are obtained. The actual coverage probabilities of these intervals are examined by simulation},

@article{Tian2008,
abstract = {Recently, there is an emerging interest in the inference of P(Y1>Y2) where Y1 and Y2 stand for two independent continuous random variables. So far, most of the research in this field focuses on simply comparing two outcomes without adjusting for covariates. This paper mainly presents a large sample approach based on a noncentral t distribution for the confidence interval estimation of P(Y1>Y2) with normal outcomes in linear models. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed large sample approach is compared with that of a generalized variable approach and a bootstrap approach. Simulation studies demonstrate that for small-to-medium sample sizes, both the large sample approach and the generalized variable approach provide confidence intervals with satisfying coverage probabilities whereas the bootstrap approach can be slightly liberal for certain scenarios. The proposed approaches are applied to three real-life data sets.},
